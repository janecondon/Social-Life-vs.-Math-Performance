# Social-Life-vs.-Math-Performance


## Introduction

In this project, we analyze data from two Portuguese high schools regarding student performance in Mathematics and Portuguese courses as well as social and demographic factors. It contains 34 columns and 395 rows, with the index being “Student ID.” There are 21 categorical variables and 13 numerical variables. In this project, we want to answer two main questions:

* Is having a more active social life associated with a better or worse mathematics grade?
* What kind of socioeconomic and demographic factors have the strongest effect on mathematics grade?

In this project, we use various techniques, including exploratory data analysis, the Wilcoxon Ranked Sum test (nonparametric two-sample t-test), the Krukal-Wallis test (nonparametric ANOVA test), and multiple linear regression to analyze the complex relationships between a student's social life and socioeconomic background, and their mathematics grades. 

## Data

The data used in this project comes from a dataset titled [“High School Student Performance & Demographics”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/high-school-student-performance-and-demographics) from Kaggle.com.

### Response Variable: Mathematics Final Grade
